    <h2> Raccon Trivia</h2>
    <p>
        People tend to be split on <strong>raccoons</strong>. I don't see why. Yes, they're feral and they dig in your trash, but think about it. 
        They're just hungry and defensive, right? I for one think they are resourceful creatures and they even have cool fur patterns too. 
        They look like little bandits. Or as Starlord would say, "Trash Panda". Their ability to rummage through nearly anything comes from their 
        dexterous hands, from which they are named. 
        According to mentalfloss.com, "the English word <em> raccoon</em> comes from the Powhatan word <em> arcoughcun</em>, which means 'animal that scratches
        with its hands.'"

        The way a raccoon looks is also quite unique. Though we are used to seeing the average white & black fellow, there are white and beige ones, fully black ones, 
        and different variations of white, black, gray, and brown. And their markings are advantageous to their survival as well. The little black mask around their eyes
        which they are so famous for acts as a light absorber. The black fur absorbs light, reducing glare and making it clearer for them to see. This also works for seeing in the dark.

        Raccoons are also very clever creatures. As long as something is food-related, they can usually crack the code. 
        Multiple studies have been done to test their resourcefulness. In the early 1900s, scientist's gave 12 raccoons a series of locks to figure out. 
        They had to navigate through 13 mechanisms (hooks, buttons, bolts, latches, levers, etc.), and they were able to get past 11. Their little hands are also
        gifted with higher sensory receptors than human hands. They can further heighten it by wetting their paws, which becomes a great tool for nighttime scavenging.

        Up to now, its a wonder why these furry cute creatures are so feared. If you're not and you have money, there's actually a raccoon cafe in Seoul, South Korea you can visit. 
        A nice sip of tea or a latte with a raccoon by your side... doesn't that sound nice?
